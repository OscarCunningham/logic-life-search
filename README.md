Now on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/OscarCunningham/logic-life-search)

Logic Life Search is a program to search for patterns in [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) (and other cellular automata) by use of a [SAT solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem#Algorithms_for_solving_SAT). It's similar to [lifesrc](http://members.canb.auug.org.au/~dbell/), [WinLifeSearch](https://github.com/jsummers/winlifesearch) and [Java Life Search](http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=990).
